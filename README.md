# ⚽ Season Differentials — Real-Time Team Over/Underperformance Tracker

## Overview

**Season Differentials** is a data project that compares how every football (soccer) team across **Europe's Top 5 Leagues** is performing this season versus the same stage last season.

Instead of just showing current league tables, this tool measures *how much better or worse* each team is doing **against the same opponents and venues** they faced last year.

**Leagues Covered:**
- 🇮🇹 Serie A
- 🏴 Premier League  
- 🇪🇸 La Liga
- 🇩🇪 Bundesliga
- 🇫🇷 Ligue 1

For example:
> Arsenal drew 1–1 at Anfield last year but won 2–0 there this season — that fixture is worth **+2 points differential**.

By computing this for every team and aggregating across gameweeks, the project reveals which clubs are the biggest **overperformers** and **underperformers** relative to last year.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

For each team and gameweek:

1. **Match equivalence:** Find this season’s fixtures that have an exact equivalent last season (same opponent + same venue).
2. **Compute points:** Assign 3/1/0 for win/draw/loss for both seasons.
3. **Per-fixture differential:**  
   \[
   \text{Differential} = \text{Points}_{25/26} - \text{Points}_{24/25}
   \]
4. **Cumulative differential:** Track the running total through each gameweek.
5. **League-wide view:** Identify biggest over- and underperformers week by week.

Fixtures involving newly promoted or relegated teams are **excluded** to avoid biasing comparisons.

## 🧩 Example

| Opponent | Venue | 24/25 Result | 25/26 Result | 24/25 Pts | 25/26 Pts | Diff |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|------------|------|
| Newcastle | A | D | W | 1 | 3 | +2 |
| Liverpool | H | L | D | 0 | 1 | +1 |
| Fulham    | A | W | L | 3 | 0 | -3 |

**Cumulative Differential:** **0** after 3 GWs (overperformers and underperformers cancel out)

### Data Source
All match data is sourced from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/), which provides comprehensive historical results and statistics for major European leagues.

The script automatically:
- Fetches latest data via `scraper.py`
- Computes points for both home and away sides (W=3, D=1, L=0)
- Matches equivalent fixtures (same opponent + venue)
- Excludes promoted/relegated teams to ensure fair comparisons

## 🧮 Outputs

Each league produces a `results.csv` file in `data/[League]/` containing:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Team` | Team name |
| `Match_Number` | Sequential match number (1, 2, 3...) |
| `Date` | Match date |
| `Opponent` | Opposition team |
| `Venue` | Home (H) or Away (A) |
| `FTHG` / `FTAG` | Full-time goals (home/away) |
| `Points_cur` | Points earned this season |
| `Points_prev` | Points earned last season (same fixture) |
| `Differential` | Points difference (cur - prev) |
| `Cumulative` | Running total of differentials |

### Example Output (Roma):
```
Team  Match_Number  Opponent    Differential  Cumulative
Roma  1             Bologna     +3.0          +3.0
Roma  2             Torino      -3.0          0.0
Roma  3             Lazio       +2.0          +2.0
Roma  4             Verona      0.0           +2.0
Roma  5             Fiorentina  +3.0          +5.0
```
