# The Gaffer's Notebook — European Football Intelligence Platform

## Overview

**The Gaffer's Notebook** is a data pipeline that tracks how every club across **Europe's Top 5 Leagues** is trending year-over-year, both at the team level and the player level. It combines results from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/) with player metrics from [Understat.com](https://understat.com/), pushes everything into Supabase each night, and exposes clean CSVs plus a database you can query or build dashboards on top of.

Instead of just showing league tables, the project measures *how much better or worse* each team is doing **against the same opponents and venues** they faced last year, and how much each player contributes to their club's goal-scoring and (soon) xG output.

**Leagues Covered:**
- 🇮🇹 Serie A
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Premier League  
- 🇪🇸 La Liga
- 🇩🇪 Bundesliga
- 🇫🇷 Ligue 1

For example:
> Arsenal drew 1–1 at Anfield last year but won 2–0 there this season — that fixture is worth **+2 points differential**.

By computing this for every team and aggregating across gameweeks, the project reveals which clubs are the biggest **overperformers** and **underperformers** relative to last year.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

For each team and gameweek:

1. **Match equivalence:** Find this season’s fixtures that have an exact equivalent last season (same opponent + same venue).
2. **Compute points:** Assign 3/1/0 for win/draw/loss for both seasons.
3. **Per-fixture differential:**  
   \[
   \text{Differential} = \text{Points}_{25/26} - \text{Points}_{24/25}
   \]
4. **Cumulative differential:** Track the running total through each gameweek.
5. **League-wide view:** Identify biggest over- and underperformers week by week.

Fixtures involving newly promoted or relegated teams are **excluded** to avoid biasing comparisons.

## 🧩 Example

| Opponent | Venue | 24/25 Result | 25/26 Result | 24/25 Pts | 25/26 Pts | Diff |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|------------|------|
| Newcastle | A | D | W | 1 | 3 | +2 |
| Liverpool | H | L | D | 0 | 1 | +1 |
| Fulham    | A | W | L | 3 | 0 | -3 |

**Cumulative Differential:** **0** after 3 GWs (overperformers and underperformers cancel out)

### Configuration

The project uses a centralized `config.py` file for all league definitions and constants:

```python
LEAGUES = {
    'serie_a': {
        'display_name': 'Serie A',
        'folder': 'serie_a',
        'fbdata_code': 'I1',
        'understat_key': 'Serie_A'
    },
    # ... other leagues
}
```

This ensures:
- Single source of truth for all league configurations
- Easy to add new leagues or modify existing ones
- Consistent naming across all scripts (snake_case)
- Proper mapping between different data sources

### Data Sources

**Team Match Data:** [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/)  
**Player Statistics:** [Understat.com](https://understat.com/)

The pipeline automatically:
- Fetches latest data via `scraper.py`
- Computes points for both home and away sides (W=3, D=1, L=0)
- Matches equivalent fixtures (same opponent + venue)
- Excludes promoted/relegated teams to ensure fair comparisons
- Analyzes player contributions from Understat data

---

## 🧮 Outputs

Each league produces a `results.csv` file in `data/[League]/` containing:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Team` | Team name |
| `Match_Number` | Sequential match number (1, 2, 3...) |
| `Date` | Match date |
| `Opponent` | Opposition team |
| `Venue` | Home (H) or Away (A) |
| `Result` | Win / Draw / Loss for the current season |
| `FTHG` / `FTAG` | Full-time goals (home/away) |
| `Points_cur` | Points earned this season |
| `Points_prev` | Points earned last season (same fixture) |
| `Differential` | Points difference (cur - prev) |
| `Cumulative` | Running total of differentials |

### Example Output (Roma):
```
Team  Match_Number  Opponent    Differential  Cumulative
Roma  1             Bologna     +3.0          +3.0
Roma  2             Torino      -3.0          0.0
Roma  3             Lazio       +2.0          +2.0
Roma  4             Verona      0.0           +2.0
Roma  5             Fiorentina  +3.0          +5.0
```

## 👥 Player Contribution Analysis

In addition to team performance, the project analyzes individual player contributions using data from [Understat.com](https://understat.com/).

Each league produces per-season `player_results_<season>.csv` files containing:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `player` | Player name |
| `team` | Current team |
| `goals` | Goals scored this season |
| `assists` | Assists provided this season |
| `contributions` | Total goal contributions (goals + assists) |
| `contribution_pct` | % of team's goals the player contributed to |
| `goals_pct` | Player's goals as % of team total |
| `assists_pct` | Player's assists as % of team total |
| `games` | Matches played |

**Example:** A player with 10 goals and 5 assists in a team that scored 50 goals would have:
- Goals%: 20.0%
- Assists%: 10.0%
- Contribution%: 30.0%

**Note:** Players who transferred mid-season are excluded from calculations to maintain accuracy.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/gkbichara/gaffers-notebook.git
cd gaffers-notebook

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1.5 Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (it’s already ignored by git) with your Supabase credentials:

```
# .env
SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_service_role_key   # use the service-role secret
```

> ⚠️ Never commit this file. The service-role key has full privileges.

Then mirror the same values in GitHub so the nightly workflow can reach Supabase:
1. GitHub repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. Add secrets named `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`
3. Re-run the “Update Football Data” workflow once to confirm the secrets work

### 1.6 Handy Make commands

Common developer tasks are wrapped in a Makefile:

```bash
make setup    # upgrade pip + install requirements
make run      # python -m src.main
make scrape   # python -m src.scraper
make analyze  # python -m src.analysis
make lint     # ruff check src
make format   # black src
```

Feel free to call the underlying `python -m ...` commands directly if you prefer.

### 2. Run Full Pipeline (Recommended)

```bash
python -m src.main
```

This runs the complete pipeline:
1. Scrapes latest team data from football-data.co.uk
2. Performs YoY analysis for all leagues
3. Fetches player contribution data from Understat
4. Exports all results to CSV files

### 3. Run Components Individually (Optional)

```bash
# Just scrape team data
python -m src.scraper

# Just run YoY team analysis
python -m src.analysis

# Just analyze player contributions
python -m src.understat_scraper
```

Output:
```
============================================================
FOOTBALL PERFORMANCE COMPARISON - SEASON DIFFERENTIALS
============================================================

[1/5] Analyzing Serie A...
✓ Saved results to data/SerieA/results.csv
   Top: Cagliari (+5)
   Bottom: Fiorentina (-7)

[2/5] Analyzing Premier League...
...
```

### 4. View Results

Results are saved in `data/[League]/` folders. Open with any spreadsheet application or pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load Serie A team YoY results
team_df = pd.read_csv('data/serie_a/results.csv')

# View Roma's performance
roma = team_df[team_df['Team'] == 'Roma']
print(roma[['Match_Number', 'Opponent', 'Differential', 'Cumulative']])

# Load season-specific player contribution data
player_df = pd.read_csv('data/serie_a/player_results_2526.csv')

# View top contributors
top_players = player_df.nlargest(20, 'contribution_pct')
print(top_players[['player', 'team', 'goals', 'assists', 'contribution_pct']])
```

### 5. Automation

The project supports automated updates via **GitHub Actions** (recommended) or local cron jobs.

#### 🤖 GitHub Actions (Recommended)

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs automatically on GitHub's servers:

**How it works:**
- ✅ Runs daily at 3 AM UTC (configurable)
- ✅ Automatically fetches latest data
- ✅ Runs analysis on all leagues
- ✅ Commits updated data to the repository
- ✅ Uploads logs as downloadable artifacts
- ✅ Works even when your computer is off!

**Manual Trigger:**
1. Go to your GitHub repo → **Actions** tab
2. Select "Update Football Data"
3. Click "Run workflow"

**View Results:**
- Updated data appears in `data/[League]/` folders
- Download logs from the Actions run page
- Check commit history for automated updates

**Customize Schedule:**

Edit `.github/workflows/update-data.yml`:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 3 * * *'  # Daily at 3 AM UTC
  # or
  - cron: '0 9 * * 1,4'  # Mon & Thu at 9 AM UTC
```

#### 🖥️ Local Automation (Alternative)

For local automation, use the included cron job setup:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add schedule (example: Mon & Thu at 9 AM)
0 9 * * 1,4 /Users/gkb/Desktop/Performance-Comparison/run_update.sh
```

**Check Logs:**
```bash
# View latest execution log
ls -t logs/ | head -1 | xargs -I {} cat logs/{}

# Monitor logs directory
tail -f logs/update_*.log
```

The `run_update.sh` script:
- ✅ Activates the virtual environment
- ✅ Executes `python -m src.main` so imports behave exactly like CI
- ✅ Logs all output with timestamps
- ✅ Retains only the 10 most recent log files
